CHANGELOG
=========

### [BC BREAK] 2013-05-06

* User's groups roles are not merged anymore when editing `User` entity. A `getRealRoles()` method has been
  added in `Sonata\UserBundle\Model\User` and is now used in `Sonata\UserBundle\Admin\UserAdmin`.

  If you still want to merge user's groups roles, you can:

     * add a `getRealRoles()` in your entity by overriding `Sonata\UserBundle\Model\User` method and
       referencing `getRoles()` parent method

### 2012-09-24

* changed service parameters into options that come through the configuration with the old values as the new defaults.

### [BC BREAK] 2012-07-21

* change impersonating definition, now the url is defined as a configuration, you don't need to create
  a custom route anymore.

     * remove ``sonata_user_impersonating`` from the routing file
     * add ``impersonating_route`` into the ``sonata_user`` configuration section

### 2012-06-08

* Introduce new field for user: firstname, lastname, gender, etc ...
* add frontend edition of profile information
